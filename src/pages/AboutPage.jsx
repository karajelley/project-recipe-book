      <p>
        Welcome to our Recipe Book app, a simple yet powerful single-page
        application built with React. This app allows users to easily create,
        manage, and explore their favorite recipes. Users can add, update, and
        delete recipes, keeping all their culinary ideas in one convenient
        location.
        <br />
        <br></br>
        The app is designed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive interface
        that makes it easy to navigate and interact with recipes. Built with
        core React concepts such as state management and component-based
        architecture, this project demonstrates how React can be used to create
        dynamic and interactive web applications.

            Hi, I'm Kara, a UX/UI designer with a strong interest in full-stack
            development and a growing skill set in React. I enjoy creating
            user-centered designs and balancing aesthetics with functionality to
            build intuitive interfaces. Currently, I'm building my coding skills
            to bring my design ideas to life. I'm excited to work on this
            project and collaborate with the team!
