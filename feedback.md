# Feedback

## Glows

1. **Code Quality**
    - Your code is well-organized and easy to read.
    - The implementation of the array methods is well done (find, filter, map).

2. **File/folder structure**
    - Your file/folder structure is well-organized. Having each component in a different folder and the corresponding css file in the same folder is a good practice.

3. **User Interface**
    - The user interface is clean and easy to use.
    - The color scheme is consistent and visually appealing.

## Grows

1. **Error Handling**
    - Error handling with the forms can be improved. Instead of using an alert, you can display an error message on the form itself.

2. **Consistency**
    - The structure of the forms and their logic can be more consistent. You have different forms with different structures and logic. Try to use the same approach for all forms.
    - There are some inconsistencies in the naming of the variables. Try to use descriptive names like `recipes` instead of `data`.
    - The organization of the components in different folders is good. However, you are not using the same approach for the pages.

3. **Responsiveness**
    - The application is almost responsive. By just adding a few media queries, you can make it fully responsive.

4. **Use of AI**
    - When asking AI for solutions during development, make sure to understand the solution and implement it in your own words. The lack of consistency in the code can be due to the direct implementation of the AI solution.

## Conclusion
